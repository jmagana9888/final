    <p> Hello! My name is Joseph but you guys can call me JM. The picture that you see on the right, was when I visited the intersection where my favorite rapper Tupac Shakur got shot. I started taking pictures during my senior year of high school. After the class ended, I took a break and didn't touch my camera for about 2 years since I wasn't really interested due to just taking the class for education requirements. During winter semester 2018, I started to gain interest again and decided to take a photography class during this time. Ever since, I started to make it a habit of taking pictures whenever I had the chance. I was taking pictures of nature, my pets, friends, my vacation to the Philippines and much more. This eventually became a habit and I was eventually taking pictures every other day. My goal is to hopefully work with other photographers around the world and possibly collaborate to create cool projects with one another. I hope you guys enjoy my page and I hope you guys find inspiration to pick up your cameras and take pictures like me! Enjoy!
